# JEE Main Auto Calculator

Last time I performed bad, I made an automatic calculator for the Answer Key.

This time I performed worse, I made a version 2.

This time its a website.

Use Ctrl+S or Cmd+S

Save response sheet as HTML not as PDF.

Edit: It was not counting the marked for review questions. Thanks to u/kitten_xoxo_meow  for correcting the code.

Edit 2: 

You guys sent me 17.85 Gigabytes of files, which make it close to 90000 successful results checked. The maths somehow doesn't add up.
